# Depth Anything 3 Project Rules

## Package Manager
- This project uses UV as the package manager
- Always use `uv run` to run Python scripts
- Use `uv pip install` to install additional packages
- Use `uv sync` to sync dependencies

## Model Information
- Uses Depth Anything 3 (DA3) from ByteDance-Seed
- Supports 5 model sizes: small, base, large, giant, nested
- Official models are hosted on Hugging Face
- Placeholder model available for testing without downloads

## Development
- Python 3.10+ required
- GPU (CUDA) recommended for large/giant/nested models
- Small model works well on CPU for real-time processing

## Testing
- Run `uv run python hello.py` to verify installation
- Run `./test_installation.sh` for full test
- Use `--model-size small` for quick testing

## API Usage
```python
from depthany_3.model import DepthAnything3
model = DepthAnything3(model_size="small")
depth = model.predict(image_rgb)  # RGB numpy array (H,W,3)
```

## CLI Usage
```bash
# Webcam
uv run depthany-webcam [--model-size MODEL] [--fps-display]

# Image
uv run depthany-image IMAGE_PATH [--show] [--output OUTPUT]
```
